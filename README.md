# MovieSwipe

## What is MovieSwipe?
MovieSwipe is a unique app that takes inspiration from dating apps, but instead of swiping on potential partners, users will be swiping on movies they want to watch. The idea is to make it easy for users to find and decide on movies to watch, either alone or with friends. The app also allows users to create groups with their friends and match movies that everyone in the group wants to see.

## Features
* Movie swiping: Users can swipe right or left on movies they want to watch, creating a list of preferred movies for future reference.
* Group creation: Users can create groups with their friends and match movies that everyone in the group wants to see.
* Movie recommendations: The app will recommend movies to users based on their swiping history and preferences.
* Movie details: Users can view detailed information about each movie, including plot summaries, trailers, ratings, and more.
* Social integration: Users can share their movie choices on social media platforms and invite friends to join groups.

## Technologies Used
* Front-end: The app will be built using React (Native?, providing a native feel for both Android and iOS users).
* Back-end: C#
* Data: TBD

## Stretch goals
* Matched movies page (with group)
* Group chat
* Group administration
* User settings
